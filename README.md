# GYMS16_Pipelined_RISCV_based_Processor_Project
This project is on designing 16-bit 5-staged pipelined RISC-V based Processor, with 0.5kB (16-bit word) data and instruction memories separately; along with 16 general-purpose registers (16-bit word). It is coded in Verilog HDL along with the help of Python script to convert Assembly code into binary based on our Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
